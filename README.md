# hola
Chat app called "Hola" which is build during DU hacks Hackathon with our team.

Thia is our first ever Hackathon for our all team members while doing planing and emplimentation we faced many issuses we don't know much more about hackathon culture and also coding but we did our best try.

For this hackathon we planded a Chat application based on website.
Which called "Hola". HOLA means hello in Spanish. For messaging app we thought that is best name for our web app.

While implimenting we face alot of problems and this project is not done finished and also not at it's best version but we solved many problems while emplimenting like database connectivty, website flexibility, verification related problems, socket related problem for message , and still there is more problems there in project.

we used technology like html , css , javascript , php .
